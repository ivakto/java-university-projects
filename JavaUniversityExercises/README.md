# Java University Projects and Practice

## Project Overview

This repository contains my organized collection of projects, laboratory exercises, and seminar work completed as part of my Technical University of Sofia, Computer and Software Engineering curriculum. It serves as a comprehensive portfolio demonstrating practical application and proficiency in core **Java (Standard Edition)** concepts and data structures.

The projects are structured by module (Lectures, Labs, Seminars) to ensure traceability and easy reference to specific academic requirements.

## Key Technical Domains

The code within this repository validates competence in the following fundamental and applied Java concepts:

| Technical Area | Specific Concepts Addressed |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Java Syntax** | Variable scoping, Control Flow (loops, conditionals), and Basic I/O operations. |
| **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** | Class design, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Abstraction. |
| **Data Structures** | Implementation and use of essential Java collections (Arrays, Lists, Maps). |
| **Algorithm Analysis** | Solutions for typical problems encountered in algorithms and data structures courses. |
| **Modular Design** | Project organization using standard Java package structure and external libraries (if applicable). |

## Repository Structure and Organization

The work is segmented into directories based on the academic format:

* `/labs/`: Solutions for mandatory laboratory exercises (`lab1`, `lab2`, etc.).
* `/seminars/`: Code developed during practical seminar sessions.
* `/book/`: Practice code or examples derived from textbooks/lecture materials.
* `/saa/`: Projects related to "Structures and Algorithms".
* `/src/`: Root directory for core application source files (if applicable, e.g., `App.java`).

## Technology Stack and Requirements

* **Language:** Java 17+ (or specify the version required by the university).
* **Build Tool:** Maven / Gradle (specify the tool used for building).
* **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code with Java Extension Pack.
* **Test Framework:** JUnit 5 (if unit testing is included in the labs/seminars).

## Local Setup and Execution

To clone this repository and execute the Java code, you must have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed and configured on your system.
